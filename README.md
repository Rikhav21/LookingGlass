# LookingGlass
So I am desinging a heads up display that I can mount to my glasses, because I saw some other designs like the optogon and DIY edith glasses, and desided that I wear glasses most of the time anyway, so why not just give them some smarts.
The optics are pretty basic, I am just using a mirror to have the oled mounted at the side of my glasses, a lens so that my eyes are actually able to focus on the image, and a beam splitter, so tha I can still see through the glasses. 
I am using a pi 5 just connected to a battery pack because that is what I have on hand, although the pi 5 is definately overkill for this project, and you also could make your own charging system. I am mounting it on a belt, as I am taking inspiration from the optogon.
So that is actually pretty much all of the stuff I have to say right now.

## Cad
So I have the CAD done for the project. I am going to print this in PLA, and most of hte parts will either be just friction fit or hotglued.

## Build
So this is the actual build of the looking glass. The display is readable, and although It cand display that many letters at a time at such a big font, I got the code to make it scroll across.
