    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      LookingGlass is a heads-up display designed to mount directly onto my glasses.
      The idea came from seeing other projects like the Optigon and DIY Edith glasses,
      and realizing that since I already wear glasses most of the time, I might as
      well give them some extra functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is to create a lightweight, usable HUD that can display information
      directly in my field of view without completely blocking vision.

    <h2>Optics & Hardware</h2>
    <p>
      The optics for LookingGlass are intentionally simple. The display is mounted
      off to the side of the glasses and reflected using a mirror. A lens allows
      my eyes to properly focus on the OLED screen, and a beam splitter lets me
      see the display while still seeing through the glasses.
    </p>

    <p>
      For computing, I’m using a Raspberry Pi 5 connected to a battery pack. This
      is definitely overkill for the project, but it’s what I had on hand. A more
      refined version could use a smaller board and a custom charging system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking inspiration from the Optigon, the Raspberry Pi and battery are mounted
      on a belt, keeping weight off the glasses themselves.

    <h2>CAD Design</h2>
    <p>
      All of the mechanical parts were designed in CAD. The parts are intended to
      be 3D printed in PLA, with most components either friction-fit or secured
      using hot glue.

    <h2>Build & Testing</h2>
    <p>
      This is the physical build of LookingGlass. The display is clearly readable,
      and while the OLED can’t show many characters at a large font size, I wrote
      code to smoothly scroll text across the screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even in this early state, the project proves that a functional, wearable HUD
      is very achievable with simple optics and off-the-shelf components.

    <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
    <p>
      Future versions could focus on reducing size and power consumption, improving
      optics, and adding more advanced software features such as notifications,
      navigation, or sensor data overlays.
